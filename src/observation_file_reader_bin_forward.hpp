     *              the needed information could be retrieved; this points

     *
     * read_type() is the method that starts the process of reading a
     * full event record, either l- or o-.
     *
     * It may be invoked right after open(), read_l_data() or read_o_data()
     * have been called only. Using this method at any other moment will
     * produce an error condition.
     *
     * Note that since this method starts the reading of a brand new
     * record, an end-of-file (or beginning-of-file) condition may
     * arise (see is_eof() for a discussion on end-of-file and
     * beginnin-of-file conditions treated uniformly by this library).
     *
     * read_type() will indicate that an end-of-file condition has been
     * detected by means of an specific error code. Other error codes
     * besides the one indicating the end of file are also possible.
     *
     * Therefore, the calling module must check the error code returned
     * by read_type() and, if not zero, check immediatelly if it
     * corresponds to either a legal end-of-file condition (using
     * is_eof()) or to any other problem.
     *
     * End-of-file conditions must not therefore be treated as errors, but
     * as the normal way to detect that the data in the input file has
     * been exhausted. See the detailed description of class
     * observation_file_reader for an example on how to check and treat this situation.
     *
     * After a successful completion, the record_type parameter will contain
     * either an 'l' or an 'o' character (always lowercas) denoting the
     * type of record being read (l- and o-records correspondingly).
